&nbsp;

## Expectations
The successful applicants will join a collaborative state-of-the-art laboratory with multiple LC-MS/MS systems and is expected to build strong collaborative partnerships within the group, as well as to develop and drive new projects within the scope of the center. Strong bioanalytical expertise and experience with high resolution quantitative mass spectrometry is desirable but not required.

## Faculty Recruitment
The [Department of Bioengineering at Northeastern University](https://bioe.northeastern.edu/) invites applications for tenured or tenure-track appointments at the assistant, associate or full professor level. We seek exceptional candidates in the area of single-cell, multi-omic technologies with the potential for driving the transition from descriptive tabulations of molecular participants in cellular systems to quantitative models of human pathophysiology.  Although a major wave of single-cell technologies was driven by RNA sequencing methodologies, we envision a next generation of approaches focused on single-cell proteomics and related technologies with applications to immuno-oncology, autoimmunity, neuroscience, developmental biology and others.  Areas of interest include, but are not limited, development of novel technologies that enable quantitative tracking of multi-faceted dynamics within single cells; advances in computational strategies that make best use of the highly complex single-cell data sets being generated; and construction of quantitative biochemical and biophysical models of cellular systems.

## Vision

>Single-cell multi-omics technologies are rapidly expanding. An exciting frontier is the comprehensive quantification of protein activities, interactions and conformations with single-cell resolution across time and space. Such analyses will be powered by emerging single-cell mass spectrometric technologies. These technologies will build quantitative biochemical and biophysical models of cellular systems and discover new drug targets. The success of such analyses will require (i) careful selection and sampling of relevant in vivo systems, including patient samples, and (ii) integration of multi-omics methods that analyze both cells and their environments. Areas poised to benefit from these developments include immuno-oncology, autoimmunity, neuroscience and developmental biology.
