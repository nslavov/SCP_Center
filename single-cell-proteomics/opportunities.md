## Projects include

* [Tracking proteome dynamics in single cells]({{site.baseurl}}/single-cell-proteomics/research#tracking-proteome-dynamics-in-single-cells)
* [Mapping Transcriptomes and Proteomes in 3D]({{site.baseurl}}/single-cell-proteomics/research#mapping-the-transcriptome-and-proteome-of-human-testis-in-3d)
* Opportunities outlined in this *Perspective* [10.1126/science.aaz6695](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6477/512)
* Candidate initiated projects

&nbsp;

## Expectations
The successful applicants will join a collaborative state-of-the-art laboratory with multiple LC-MS/MS systems and is expected to build strong collaborative partnerships within the group, as well as to develop and drive new projects within the scope of the center. Strong bioanalytical expertise and experience with high resolution quantitative mass spectrometry is desirable but not required.
