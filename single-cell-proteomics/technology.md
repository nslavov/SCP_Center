### [Technologies for analyzing protein in single cells](http://slavovlab.net/research.htm#SCoPE-MS)
Single Cell ProtEomics by MS (SCoPE-MS) and its second generation, SCoPE2,
use multiplexed experimental designs in which proteins from single cells and from the total cell lysate of a small group of cells (called carrier proteins) are barcoded and then combined. With this design, the [isobaric carrier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02069) reduces the loss of proteins from single cells adhering to equipment surfaces while simultaneously enhancing peptide identification.
