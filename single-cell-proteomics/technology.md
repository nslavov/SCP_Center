## Shotgun single-cell proteomics
[SCoPE-MS](https://scp.slavovlab.net/SCoPE-MS) and its second version [SCoPE2](https://scp.slavovlab.net/SCoPE2) can analyze thousands of proteins selected in order of their abundance in the samples. [SCoPE2](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02267-5) uses multiplexed experimental designs in which proteins from single cells and from a small group of cells (called carrier proteins) are barcoded with isobaric mass tags and then combined. This design, utilizes the [isobaric carrier](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00675) to reduce the loss of proteins from single cells adhering to equipment surfaces while simultaneously enhancing peptide identification.

## Prioritized single-cell proteomics
[pSCoPE](https://scp.slavovlab.net/pSCoPE) can analyze thousands of proteins selected in order of their priority for the biological question and project of interest.

## Parallel analysis of both single cells and peptides
[plexDIA][plexDIA] parallelizes the analysis of both single cells and peptides. It quantifies about a thousand proteins per single cell while achieving 98% data completeness within a set. It does not use a carrier sample.

## Sample preparation for single-cell proteomics
We have developed and use methods that use solely MS-compatible reagents and allow parallel preparation of hundreds of single cells in small volumes. These include [minimal sample preparation](https://sample-prep.slavovlab.net/mass-spec/mPOP) and [droplet sample preparation](https://sample-prep.slavovlab.net/POP).
