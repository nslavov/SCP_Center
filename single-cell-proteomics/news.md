## News and media highlights

### [Slavov Named Paul G. Allen Distinguished Investigator for Pioneering Single Cell Proteomics Research](https://coe.northeastern.edu/news/slavov-named-paul-g-allen-distinguished-investigator-for-pioneering-single-cell-proteomics-research/) &nbsp;   Oct 2020

The Allen Frontiers Group awarded an [Allen Distinguished Investigator Award](https://alleninstitute.org/what-we-do/frontiers-group/distinguished-investigators/projects/tracking-proteome-dynamics-single-cells) to support the development of a new technique, dubbed [SCoPE-Dyn](http://slavovlab.net/research.htm#SCoPE-Dyn), that will allow researchers to follow an individual cell’s “protein travelogue”: the changes over time in hundreds of different proteins across thousands of human cells.
